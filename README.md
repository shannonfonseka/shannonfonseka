[^1]: main reasons are because i discovered a "free" version of OBS and Captura was sold on Microsoft Store by some clown with all open source licenses removed; see https://github.com/MathewSachin/Captura/issues/405 .
fearing for people stealing my work i am making all my projects private with a custom license.
[^2]: since my website and other material is hosted on a home-made webserver, frequent downtimes may arise. the site is under construction
