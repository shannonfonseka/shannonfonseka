#### **🛠️ i currently work on:**

> all my major projects have now moved to my org mentioned below. you can find all my active projects' development over there. this profile now mainly hosts a few smaller personal experiments and my academic related repos. explore everything at the org to see the full work!
>
> want to check my repos anyway? click [here](https://github.com/shannonfonseka?tab=repositories)

> #### 💡 note
>
> many of my projects are deeply personal and represent countless hours of effort. while i value open-source collaboration, i prefer to keep certain source code private. if you’re interested in contributing, feel free to reach out privately. thank you for understanding! [^1]

[^1]: main reasons are because i discovered a "free" version of OBS and Captura was sold on Microsoft Store by someone with all open source licenses removed; see [here](https://github.com/MathewSachin/Captura/issues/405). fearing for people stealing my work i am making all my projects private with a custom license.

[^2]: this is my personal webserver and since my website and other material is hosted on a home-made webserver, frequent downtimes may arise. and the site is under construction, you may see broken links and missing content.
