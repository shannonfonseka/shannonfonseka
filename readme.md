#### 👋🏼 Hi there, visitor!

- 👦🏻 I’m Shannon Fonseka, 21, living in Sri Lanka.

- 👀 I am interested in computer programming, database & server management, photo & video editing, television & radio broadcasting, and 3D animation & design.

- 🌱 I am currently a student, actively looking for a job and learning `C#` in WPF, `Python` for Windows, and `Kotlin` for Android. I have learned `VB.NET`, and `Pascal`.

> [!NOTE]
> To be frank, most of my projects on this platform are a culmination of countless hours, endless nights and sacrifices made by me. While I understand the importance of sharing knowledge and contributing to a collection of ideas, I am scared that my personal attachment to this work make me want to keep my the source code confidential. This is not to show a disinterest in the open-source community but it is a simple reflection of my desire to protect something that holds great emotional value to me. If you would like to contribute to any of the projects, please let me know about it privately.

> Thank you for understanding.
