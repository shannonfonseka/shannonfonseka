#### **1. purpose**
as a sole developer, i am committed to creating secure, reliable open-source and closed-source projects on github. this security policy outlines my approach to identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities in my projects.

#### **2. reporting vulnerabilities**
if you identify a potential security vulnerability in any of my projects, please contact me about the affected project directly using the contacts options in my website or draft a **[new security advisory here](https://github.com/shannonfonseka/shannonfonseka/security/advisories/new)**. i aim to acknowledge and respond to all security-related communications within **seven to thirty business days**.

#### **3. handling of vulnerabilities**
upon receiving a vulnerability report, i will:
  - **investigate** the issue to confirm and assess its impact.
  - **develop a fix** if a vulnerability is confirmed, prioritising patches based on the severity.
  - **communicate** with the reporter (when applicable) to provide updates on the issue and the timeline for a fix.
  - **release an update** and document the vulnerability resolution in the project's changelog or security advisory.

#### **4. disclosure policy**
i request that anyone identifying a vulnerability refrains from publicly disclosing it until i have had an opportunity to address the issue. i will credit the reporter for any vulnerabilities identified and reported responsibly, unless anonymity is requested.

#### **5. security commitment**
i am committed to continuous learning and updating my projects to adhere to best security practices. i welcome any feedback from the community to enhance the security of my projects.

to every security researcher; thank you for helping maintain the security of my projects!
