**1. Purpose**
As a sole developer, I am committed to creating secure, reliable open-source and closed-source projects on GitHub. This security policy outlines my approach to identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities in my projects.

**2. Reporting Vulnerabilities**
If you identify a potential security vulnerability in any of my projects, please contact me about the affected project directly using the contacts options in my profile or draft a **[new security advisory](https://github.com/shannonfonseka/shannonfonseka/security/advisories/new)**. I aim to acknowledge and respond to all security-related communications within **seven business days**.

**3. Handling of Vulnerabilities**
Upon receiving a vulnerability report, I will:
  - **Investigate** the issue to confirm and assess its impact.
  - **Develop a fix** if a vulnerability is confirmed, prioritising patches based on the severity.
  - **Communicate** with the reporter (when applicable) to provide updates on the issue and the timeline for a fix.
  - **Release an update** and document the vulnerability resolution in the project's changelog or security advisory.

**4. Disclosure Policy**
I request that anyone identifying a vulnerability refrains from publicly disclosing it until I have had an opportunity to address the issue. I will credit the reporter for any vulnerabilities identified and reported responsibly, unless anonymity is requested.

**5. Security Commitment**
I am committed to continuous learning and updating my projects to adhere to best security practices. I welcome any feedback from the community to enhance the security of my projects.

To every security researcher; thank you for helping maintain the security of my projects!
